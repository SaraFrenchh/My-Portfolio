        title: "Analysis of\_Spotify"
        text: >
          I was enthusiastic about conducting an analysis of Spotify's top
          artists and their most popular songs. I often notice that I repeatedly
          listen to the same five songs. This project provided me with the
          opportunity to explore a diverse range of music by using drill through
          functionality to add additional information to the charts.

          This was an enjoyable project in which I conducted an analysis of
          various beer recipes. Itâ€™s particularly beneficial for individuals
          with prior brewing experience or those interested in giving it a try.
          I utilized drill-through functionality to enhance the information
          within the presentation.
